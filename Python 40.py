# ── PART 1: The problem — set n = 4 rounds ───────────────────────────────────

# We will solve "find the total" THREE ways and count the steps each one takes.

# ── PART 2: Formula way — always 1 step ──────────────────────────────────────
# Algorithm : Use the shortcut formula to get the answer instantly
# Pseudocode : total = n * (n + 1) / 2
# Time cost : 1 step — stays the same no matter how big n is
# Space cost : 1 variable (total)

# ── PART 3: Loop way — n steps ────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Algorithm : Add each round's points one by one using a loop
# Pseudocode : FOR round FROM 1 TO n: total = total + round
# Time cost : n steps — grows with the number of rounds
# Space cost : 2 variables (total, round_num)

# Time cost : roughly n*n steps — explodes as n grows!
